- Expand the -t output to be even more useful. Make sure callbacks
  (events) are also handled.

- Change terminology in code and comments: "Original application" =
  for example Word or Excel. "Replacement application" = for example
  Collabora Office. "Proxied application" is too unclear, we use the
  "proxy" term too much already.

- Including a coclass should automatically also include its default
  interface and default source interface, if any. (For instance, if
  Word.Application is mentioned in the -I file, it should not be
  necessary to mention Word._Application and Word.ApplicationEvents4.)
