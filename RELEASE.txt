How to release COLEAT binaries

- Bump the version number in include/coleat-version.h

- git commit it, git push

- In Visual Studio, select the "Release x64" configuration

-- Clean Solution, Build Solution

-- Select the "Release x86" configuration

-- Clean Solution, Build Solution

   (In that order so that the bin/coleat.exe and bin/coleatw.exe are
   the 32-bit ones, so that it will run on a 32-bit OS.)

- Run createZipAndTarball.sh

- git push

- On GitHub, do a release: Create a new tag in the format like v0.6,
  select the coleat-x.y-timestamp.hash.zip created by
  createZipAndTarball.sh to upload and attach the the release.
